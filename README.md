##Update - A team of talented people made the pyrosetta notebooks that I had only dreamed of having. Many thanks to that team for the wonderful product they created. My contributions were very modest & I only hope to highlight their significant work.

#This is an initial organization of the code examples that I have been working on
 this is in preparation for working on a full online book version
This code is a mix of old and new pyrosetta bindings.

## Notes

membrane protein has a gif showing the simulation that is designed

poses and dataframes has lots of words

symmetry has lots of maths

1/2 testers tell me that enzdes works out of the box!

##

and please ignore sjb_util unless you are trying to run examples that need it.
It has not been cleaned up for the demos
